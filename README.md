# Chip8OdinEmu

A Chip-8 emulator written in Odin

> Requires [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/minifb) (*MIT License*) - A pixel framebuffer library - to be compiled into `minifb.lib` (Windows) or `libminifb.a` (Posix-based) and stored at `lib/`.
>
> Bindings are manually created under `src.*/minifb/` translating the headers the repository contains
>
> The precompiled library can be found at `ci_builds` in [minifb-builds](https://github.com/mosobman/minifb-builds)


*TODO: Separate **Chip-8**, **SuperChip-8** and **XO-Chip-8** into individual branches and keep `main` for binaries.*
